##So You're Working the DevLocal Front Desk...

###How to Open the Office

* Put out the sandwich board sign on the street. It lives by the front door in the hallway.
* Unlock the front door. Key operates the deadbolt, but to unlock the door, look at the edge of the door where the latch is. There are two round buttons. Push the bottom one in to unlock the door so other folks can get in.
* Turn on the lights. There are switches in the entryway (including on the remote that connects to the floor lamps), in the kitchen, near the bars, and on the pillar behind front desk. Each floor lamp is on its own switch which is controlled by the remote (button 1 “on” turns all of them on). There is one floor lamp by the couches that is not on the remote yet.

###List of Daily Tasks

* Check plant schedule in this manual to see if they need watering.
* Check kitchen to clean up or wipe down surfaces. Load any dishes in the sink; run dishwasher and unload as needed.
* Check coffee, tea, half and half, and sugar. Leave a note if they are low; use petty cash to get some at PCC if they are out.
* Make a pot of coffee. Beans, scale, filters, and grinder are all on the coffee bar. The instructions for how to make coffee are posted by the machine.
* Refill tea pot and K-Cup machine with filtered water.
* Help people who need help and answer questions as needed.

###How to Close the Office

* Send an email with the subject line "Notes from the DevLocal front desk -- date" to Autumn, Carter, and Ryan with any happenings, including folks who came in for a tour, changes to the space, etc.
* Bring in the sandwich board from the street. It lives outside the office door in the hallway.
* Lock the front door if you're the last one out (or after 9 pm). Key operates the deadbolt, but to lock the door, look at the edge of the door where the latch is. There are two round buttons. Push the top one in to lock the door.
* Turn off the lights if you’re the last one out.
* Empty the compost, trash, and recycle bins (see manual for details on where they go)
* Run the dishwasher if there are more than just a few things in it.

##General Front Desk Operations

###OFFICE SUPPLIES

###Inventory and location of what we have

Extra office supplies are located in the storage area in a haphazard arrangement. We have:
* Screws and nuts and bolts
* Hand screwdriver, hammer, allen wrenches
* Tape, including electrical and painter and velcro
* Pens, pencils, scissors, envelopes, printer paper
* Lots of electrical wires and misc. tech gadgetry connectors
* Locks for the lockers

There are also office supplies in the front desk small drawers, like tape, scissors, stapler, hole punch, rubber cement, a shredder, and more.

In a pinch, additional chargers/cables can be found in the Open Device lab drawer devotes to chargers and cables.

###How to get a ladder

Right now we have a ladder! It is in the storage area. If the people who we, um, borrowed it from come for it, we’ll need to get a ladder elsewhere. To do this: go downstairs to the wine shop, and ask the guy who is working there for one. He is the building manager type dude, and he can get you one.

###Petty Cash

Petty cash of $50 is located in the top drawer of Autumn’s side desk (the grey thing with the awesome plant on top of it). Please put your receipt and note details of expenditures on the slip of paper in the envelope.

###Fedex Account
The Fedex account number for DevLocal/Formidable Labs (for admin only, not for members to use) is #523344447.

##Key Folks & Contact Info

###WHO TO TALK TO FOR: 	

###Tech Support

The routers are located on top of the lockers, and in the conference room, and in the ceiling above the large white board in the Formidable Labs office. Power off, wait 60 seconds, power back on. Carter or Ryan Roemer (in the Formidable office) can help you trouble shoot. Contact Comcast for outage issues, once routers have been reset if the problem isn’t resolving. The business service number is 1-800-391-3000, and our account number is 8498-32-001-4434348.

###Facilities Issues

The facilities guy for the building is Michael, and his cell (he likes texts, too) is 206-427-1651. For other issues or construction needs like a whiteboard falling off the wall or a lighting track falling off the ceiling (usually run by Ryan first), our contractor is Myron and his cell phone is 206-354-6095 (he also likes texts).

###Membership Questions

Have interested folks send an email to both info@devlocal.io, and carter@devlocal.io with a little about themselves, and any questions that they have. Existing members can contact the same emails with any questions, or you can find out answers and get back to them personally (preferred).

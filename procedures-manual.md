##So You're Working the DevLocal Front Desk...

###How to Open the Office

* Put out the sandwich board sign on the street. It lives by the front door in the hallway.
* Unlock the front door. Key operates the deadbolt, but to unlock the door, look at the edge of the door where the latch is. There are two round buttons. Push the bottom one in to unlock the door so other folks can get in.
* Turn on the lights. There are switches in the entryway (including on the remote that connects to the floor lamps), in the kitchen, near the bars, and on the pillar behind front desk. Each floor lamp is on its own switch which is controlled by the remote (button 1 “on” turns all of them on). There is one floor lamp by the couches that is not on the remote yet.

###List of Daily Tasks

* Check plant schedule in this manual to see if they need watering.
* Check kitchen to clean up or wipe down surfaces. Load any dishes in the sink; run dishwasher and unload as needed.
* Check coffee, tea, half and half, and sugar. Leave a note if they are low; use petty cash to get some at PCC if they are out.
* Make a pot of coffee. Beans, scale, filters, and grinder are all on the coffee bar. The instructions for how to make coffee are posted by the machine.
* Refill tea pot and K-Cup machine with filtered water.
* Help people who need help and answer questions as needed.

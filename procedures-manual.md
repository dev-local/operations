##So You're Working the DevLocal Front Desk...

###How to Open the Office

* Put out the sandwich board sign on the street. It lives by the front door in the hallway.
* Unlock the front door. Key operates the deadbolt, but to unlock the door, look at the edge of the door where the latch is. There are two round buttons. Push the bottom one in to unlock the door so other folks can get in.
* Turn on the lights. There are switches in the entryway (including on the remote that connects to the floor lamps), in the kitchen, near the bars, and on the pillar behind front desk. Each floor lamp is on its own switch which is controlled by the remote (button 1 “on” turns all of them on). There is one floor lamp by the couches that is not on the remote yet.

###List of Daily Tasks

* Check plant schedule in this manual to see if they need watering.
* Check kitchen to clean up or wipe down surfaces. Load any dishes in the sink; run dishwasher and unload as needed.
* Check coffee, tea, half and half, and sugar. Leave a note if they are low; use petty cash to get some at PCC if they are out.
* Make a pot of coffee. Beans, scale, filters, and grinder are all on the coffee bar. The instructions for how to make coffee are posted by the machine.
* Refill tea pot and K-Cup machine with filtered water.
* Help people who need help and answer questions as needed.

###How to Close the Office

* Send an email with the subject line "Notes from the DevLocal front desk -- date" to Autumn, Carter, and Ryan with any happenings, including folks who came in for a tour, changes to the space, etc.
* Bring in the sandwich board from the street. It lives outside the office door in the hallway.
* Lock the front door if you're the last one out (or after 9 pm). Key operates the deadbolt, but to lock the door, look at the edge of the door where the latch is. There are two round buttons. Push the top one in to lock the door.
* Turn off the lights if you’re the last one out.
* Empty the compost, trash, and recycle bins (see manual for details on where they go)
* Run the dishwasher if there are more than just a few things in it.

##General Front Desk Operations

###OFFICE SUPPLIES & GENERALITIES

###Inventory and location of what we have

Extra office supplies are located in the storage area in a haphazard arrangement. We have:
* Screws and nuts and bolts
* Hand screwdriver, hammer, allen wrenches
* Tape, including electrical and painter and velcro
* Pens, pencils, scissors, envelopes, printer paper
* Lots of electrical wires and misc. tech gadgetry connectors
* Locks for the lockers

There are also office supplies in the front desk small drawers, like tape, scissors, stapler, hole punch, rubber cement, a shredder, and more.

In a pinch, additional chargers/cables can be found in the Open Device lab drawer devotes to chargers and cables.

###How to get a ladder

Right now we have a ladder! It is in the storage area. If the people who we, um, borrowed it from come for it, we’ll need to get a ladder elsewhere. To do this: go downstairs to the wine shop, and ask the guy who is working there for one. He is the building manager type dude, and he can get you one.

###Petty Cash

Petty cash of $50 is located in the top drawer of Autumn’s side desk (the grey thing with the awesome plant on top of it). Please put your receipt and note details of expenditures on the slip of paper in the envelope.

###Fedex Account
The Fedex account number for DevLocal/Formidable Labs (for admin only, not for members to use) is #523344447.

###LIGHTS & HEAT

###Heat

There are thermostats in the lounge area by the coffeebar, and in the private offices. If the heat isn’t working or is too loud or is too effective at working, contact Michael to have it fixed (see contact info at the end of this document).

###Which Lights Come On When

Turn all lights on when you come in. There is a list of lights by the front door. The bar lighting is on a dimmer switch if you need to set the mood for the evening for an event.

###Remote Control for Lighting

To add or reset the lighting remote control modules (that the floor lamps are plugged into) hold down the yellow “Learning” button on the side of the module until the red LED on the front flashes. Let go of the yellow button, and hit the “on” button on the remote that you want to synch it to. 

The desks are also on the remote, so if the lights or power strips aren’t working, check and reconnect the two remote control modules that the extension cords are attached to. There are additional remotes and an additional plug module in the red storage shelving area.

###Spare Lightbulbs

All kinds are located in a single cube in the red storage box, including bulbs for the overhead cans, the bar pendants, and the floor lights.

###WATERING THE PLANTS

###Schedule

Large Plants (check on the 1st and 15th):
The large potted plants are in self watering pots. In each pot you will see a black dipstick coming out of the red cylinder. If the dipstick is high in the pot, and goes down a lot when depressed with a finger, there is water in the pot. If it is low, add a gallon of water with 7 drops of plant food to the pot by pouring into the red cylinder. 

Wall-Mounted Air Plants (mist on the 1st):
The airplants mounted near the kitchen need light misting twice a month. The mister is located near the watering can and plant food on the kitchen shelf. One spray into each glass globe is quite sufficient.

Kitchen Plants & Spider Plant on Reception Desk (Weekly on Monday):
These guys need to be thoroughly watered every week. The kitchen plants should be watered by filling their pots until water is visible on the surface of the soil (they are aquatic loving). The spider plant should be put in the kitchen sink and watered fully, then allowed to drain before placing back on the dish on the shelf. Both should be fertilized once a month on the first.

Succulent Collections on Coffee Tables (Water/mist on the first):
These don’t need much water, but they do need some. Mist and water thoroughly monthly, removing dead foliage and checking for mites and other critters. Mites can be killed with a solution of dish soap applied to the mite-infested area.

###RESERVING MEETING ROOMS

There are small glass whiteboards adjacent to each meeting room where reservations for upcoming times and dates can be written.

###SELLING NEW MEMBERSHIPS/GIVING TOURS

###Types & Perks of Each

See devlocal.io for current info about each membership level.

###Tours

Show them around the space, including conference rooms and phone booths and the back deck. Ask them what they do/are working on. Collect their personal information on the sign in sheet before the tour, and then give them carter@devlocal.io and info@devlocal.io and tell them to email if they are interested, want to sign up, or have questions. Include their contact info in your emailed report at the end of the day, including what you thought about them as potential members.

###MANNING THE FRONT DESK

You can feel free to work in the adjoining couch or conference rooms as needed, though of course it is best to stay at the desk if practical. For breaks longer than like coffee or bathroom (like, lunch, for instance), there is a sign in the grey shelf area that indicates you are not here, and for people to sign in on their own. Put it out on the desk until you return. 

Hours of operation: you should be in the office by 9:30, and stay until 4:30. Feel free to come in earlier or stay later if you have your own work to do or just feel like hanging out.

###EVENTS

If we have an event in the evening, you should print out a sign (see documents in GitHub for template) and put it on the message board, letting members know that there is an event and the times and if it is open to the public/members or if it is private.

Check with the organizer (Carter, Ryan or Autumn) to see if they need help with anything (trash bins put out, desks moved, etc.)

Organizers should arrange with cleaning folks (currently Emma) 48 hours in advance if they are going to need help cleaning up or reseting the space after an evening event.

###LOCKS & KEYS

Extra keys for all of the offices are located in the grey side desk, directly under the plant. They should mostly have tags on them to indicate which door them unlock but are occasionally ambiguously tagged so you may need to play around with them. 

###How to lock the front door

###Bathroom keys

They are attached to NES controllers hanging near the breakfast bar and should, incidentally, be sanitized on a regular basis. Extra bathroom keys are in the aforementioned cupboard nook.

###Front door keys

Only full time members get their own keys. If someone asks for a key, and they’re not a new, paid full time member, have them email Autumn and explain what happened to their old key, as we may charge them for replacement. In all cases, write down their name if you give them a key, and check their name against the membership list in Cobot to make sure they are authorized to have one.

###Private Office Keys

If someone loses their private office key, just give them another copy. If we’re running low on extra copies for their office, send Autumn an email and let her know. The only people with private offices right now are Colin and his two team mates, Lauren and Mel (with Formidable), and Alex, Ryan Eastridge, and Ryan Roemer (also with Formidable).

###Times to Lock & Unlock

Doors unlock with the first people in the morning (usually Ryan Roemer is here by 6 am). Even if there are people here, lock the front door at 9 pm. Doors stay locked on the weekend.

###AUDIO & VISUAL

###Speakers in the main area

The receiver is on top of the lockers; power on. The correct input setting on the receiver for the sound input jack by the front desk is CD; if you cycle through the input options, CD is the correct one. There is a 5-speaker surround sound system for the space, with a subwoofer on the floor to the right of the grey lockers. The sub has its own volume so can be turned up or down depending on the tenor of the event/music, etc. 

There is an office iPhone that is filled with music for the space during the day. The playlist is long and is intended to be played on random during business hours to make the space feel less like a quiet library. That being said, the volume should still be low. Turn on the music when you arrive in the morning.

There is also a podium microphone available to be plugged into the speakers. The input at the podium is different from the input at the front desk (not sure what it is off the top of my head, but cycling through the inputs on the receiver should get you the answer you seek).

###Projector

The hook up for the projector is at the podium; there are HDMI and VGA as well as some adapters for mini-DVI and something else. The remote to power it on is also on the podium. You'll need to turn off overhead lights by the door for effective projector use.

###WIFI & TECHNICAL SUPPORT

###What to do if the internet slows down

Carter or Ryan Roemer are the folks who’ve set up the internet to make it faster and so if it slows down, you should talk to them.
 
###What to do if the internet goes out

The routers are both on top of the lockers, they are all the crap in the conference room with the storage, and there is one in the ceiling tiles in the Formidable Labs office. Power everything off. This means turn off the power strips in the conference room and manually depower the other two routers. Wait. Power everything back on. 

###Printing

The Epson printer is on the wireless network, and should connect for folks automatically. There is extra printer paper in the storage area. People with older computers may need to install a driver.

###KITCHEN

###Trash, Compost & Recycling

The receptacles for the trash, compost, and unsorted recycling and broken-down cardboard are located behind the building in the alley.  There are clean compost bags and special SimpleHuman trash bags under the kitchen sink; there are small trash/recycle bags on the righthand metal shelf in the storage area in the conference room; in the same area, you’ll find extra big black trash bags in case you need them. There are large event trash/recycle bins (line with black liners) on top of the red storage shelving in the conference room.

###Dishwasher & Dishes

The dishwasher is preset with how it likes to run; you’ll find liquid dish detergent under the kitchen sink. There are a limited number of coffee cups, so keep an eye on supply and run as needed, even if the machine is not totally full. Smaller mugs hang on the hooks over the coffee/tea station; larger mugs/steins hang over the kitchen sink; overflow live in the cupboard. Put away dry, clean dishes as needed. Round up dirty abandoned cups and mugs from the conference room, Formidable Labs, private offices, etc.

###Supplies for Coffee/Tea

There is extra tea, coffee (in bags and in K-Cups) and creamer in the kitchen in the lazy susan cabinet. If those stores are exhausted, there is some back up in the storage area of the conference room, on the right hand metal shelf. The current opened bag of coffee beans lives on the coffee bar by the carafe. Tougo Coffee folks bring more coffee and tea by on a weekly basis.

###Cleaning Supplies

Under the sink you will find pads for the wet swiffer, glass spray, bleach spray, compost bags, and other misc. cleaning things. In the closet by the lockers you will find a broom, dustpan, a swiffer thing, and a brand new vaccum. The cleaning people come twice a week, but it is entirely possible that you will need to do touchups on the floors in between if they get gross. The bathroom is cleaned by the office building folks, but if it is gross or out of supplies you can let Dan or Michael know (see contact info at the end of this document).
